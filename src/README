This program reads the ADC input (10 kHz and 12 bit) and send it over the radio using the CC2420 (RF chip). Afterwards, the sent samples are outputted at the DAC on the receiver seide.

Data flow of the samples:
Sender: ADC->DMA->Buffer->CC2420
Receiver: CC2420->Buffer->DMA->DAC

The code consists of 5 main components:
adc.c and dac.c: - handles the initialization of the ADC/DAC using a timer
		 - sampling rate: 10 kHz, 12 bit

dma.c:		 - configures the DMA Controller to interact with the ADC/DAC.
		 - includes the interrupts that are triggered, when a sample buffer was completely filled or outputted

rf.c:		 - handles the initialization of the SPI interface, which is required to communite with the CC2420
		 - initializes the CC2420 (configuring registers)
		 - handles the sending and receiving of packets

main.c:		 - puts all components together
