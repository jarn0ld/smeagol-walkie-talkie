<p>Welcome to Audio Group of SMEAGOL Project 2014 the Small, Embedded, Advanced and Generic Objects Laboratory at RWTH Aachen University. </p>

<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to stream voice over a radio link. This includes voice recording, voice transmission and playback.
As radio nodes telosb´s needed to be used. This nodes are pretty power full battery powered devices including a micro-controller, a 2.4GHz radio transceiver and some sensors. </p>

<p>Besides the two telosb´s some hardware was required to condition the microphone signal and to amplifie the output signal so that it can be used to drive earphones or a speaker.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mic_amp/schematic.png" alt="alt text" title="Schematic of Microphone Amplifier">
To generate electrical signals out out of sound waves a microphone is needed. For our purposes a electret microphone is right choice because of its small dimensions, its small price and
its good usability. However, the electrical signal generated by the microphone is ways to small for the telosb`s ADC. Therefore, the signal needs to be amplified to match up with the dynamic range
of the ADC. In order to do so we used an OpAmp as an amplifier in negative feedback configuration.  However before amplification the microphone needs to be biased through resistor R1. After amplification it is important to introduce a band limitation in order to satisfy Nyquist's theorem.
Therefore, a low pass is formed by R4 and C4 with a cut cuff below 4kHz.</p>

<a name="things-to-notice" class="anchor" href="#things-to-notice"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Things to Notice</h4>

<p>As this board circuit will be mounted directly beneath the transmitting node it is very important to be aware of the radio interference. Therefore, a proper ground plane is a must have, signal lines should be as short as possible and all supply pins should be closely decoupled.   </p>
